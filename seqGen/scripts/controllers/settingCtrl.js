/**
    This controller is responsible for the views/settings.html where the user can add/remove courses
    The controller interacts with two services, CourseList and SelectedCourses
    CourseList will pass ALL the courses (from services/allCourses.js) to this controller for manipulation
    SelectedCourses will provide the current semester (from previous view)
    SelectedCourses will also receive the completed courses that the user selected, which is used later on in the code (sequenceCtrl)
